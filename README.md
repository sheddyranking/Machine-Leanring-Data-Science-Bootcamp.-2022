This Repository is for Machine Learning and Data Science Boot-camp. from Beginner to Advanced  

### Data Manipulation With Pandas 
Here the most relevant ATTRIBUTES AND FUNCTIONS in Python Pandas were used to Select, View and Manipulate the dataset `Car_sales.csv` and `Car_sales_missing.csv` click here to view codes: https://github.com/sheddyranking/Machine-Leanring-Data-Science-Bootcamp.-2022/blob/main/Pandas_Data_Manipulation.ipynb

#### Pandas Practice
Pandas Practice with outline questine to familirize with the code Above Click here to view codes: https://github.com/sheddyranking/Machine-Leanring-Data-Science-Bootcamp.-2022/blob/main/Excercise/pandas-exercises.ipynb

### Numerical Manipulation with python NumPy
Imported NumPy, Created Diiferent Dimensionl of Array, also used Functions to create array, Performed mathimatical operations on the arrays, index slicing, Transpose, sort, Dot product calculation with it's practical application, converted images to numpy ndarrays using the `imread` function from matplotlib.

### The Scikit 
This Notebook contian a detailed breakdown on how to build a Machine Learning Model, Save and load it.
Two Machine Learn Model where build for Classification `RandomForestRegressor` problem using `heart_diseas` data & and Regression `RandomForestRegressor` problem using `Car_sales` & `California housing price` data. The Models where Evaluating on Classification and Regression Metrices and improved using `RandomSearchCV` and `GridsearchCV`.
